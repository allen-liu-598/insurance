# Notes

1. Customer segmentation: Different customers tend to have specific expectations for the insurance business. Insurance marketing applies various techniques to increase the number of customers and to assure targeted marketing strategies.
   The algorithms perform customersâ€™ segmentation according to their financial sophistication, age, location, etc. Thus, all the customers are classified into groups by spotting coincidences in their attitude, preferences, behavior, or personal information. This grouping allows developing attitude and solutions especially relevant for the particular customers.
